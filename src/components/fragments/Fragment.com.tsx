    A fragment is a component that allows you to group multiple elements without adding an extra DOM element. It's a way to return multiple elements from a component's render method without having to wrap them in a single parent element. Fragments help improve the structure of your JSX code and avoid unnecessary nesting in the DOM. You can use an empty angle bracket syntax '<></>'
